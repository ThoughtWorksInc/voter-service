# Voter Service

## Introduction

The Voter [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) RESTful Web Service, backed by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), is used for DevOps-related training and testing. The Voter service exposes several HTTP API endpoints, listed below. API users can review a static list candidates (based on the 2016 US Presidential Election), submit a vote, view voting results, and inspect technical information about the running service. API users can also create random voting data by calling the `/simulation` endpoint.

## Quick Start for Local Development

The Voter service requires MongoDB to be pre-installed and running locally, on port `27017`. The service will create the `voters` database on startup. To clone, build, test, and run the Voter service locally:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch master \
  https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/voter-service.git
cd voter-service
./gradlew clean cleanTest build
java -jar build/libs/voter-service-0.2.0.jar
```

## Getting Started with API
The easiest way to get started with the Voter service API, using [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) from the command line:
1. View a list of candidates: `http http://localhost:8099/candidates`
2. Create sample voter data: `http http://localhost:8099/simulation`
3. View sample voter results: `http http://localhost:8099/results`

## Service Endpoints

By default, the service runs on `localhost`, port `8099`. By default, the service looks for MongoDB on `localhost`, port `27017`.

The [HAL Browser](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser) API browser for the `hal+json` media type is installed alongside the service. It can be accessed at `http://localhost:8099/actuator/`.

## Voting

Submitting a new vote, requires an HTTP `POST` request to the `/votes` endpoint, as follows:

HTTPie

```text
http POST http://localhost:8099/votes candidate="Jill Stein"
```

cURL

```text
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "candidate": "Jill Stein" }' \
  "http://localhost:8099/votes"
```

wget

```text
wget --method POST \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --body-data '{ "candidate": "Jill Stein" }' \
  --no-verbose \
  --output-document - http://localhost:8099/votes
```

## Continuous Integration

The project's source code is continuously built and tested on every commit to [GitHub](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/voter-service), using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ThoughtWorksInc/voter-service). If all unit tests pass, the resulting Spring Boot JAR is pushed to the `artifacts` branch of the [ThoughtWorksInc/voter-service](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/voter-service/tree/artifacts) GitHub repository. The JAR's filename is incremented with each successful build (i.e. `voter-service-0.2.10.jar`).

## Spring Profiles

The Voter service includes (3) Spring Boot Profiles, in a multi-profile YAML document: `src/main/resources/application.yml`. The profiles are `default`, `aws-production`, and `docker-production`. You will need to ensure your MongoDB instance is available at that `host` address and port of the profile you choose, or you may override the profile's properties.


```yaml
server:
  port: 8099
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      host: localhost
      port: 27017
      database: voters
logging:
  level:
    root: INFO
info:
  java:
    source: ${java.version}
    target: ${java.version}
management:
  info:
    git:
      mode: full
    build:
      enabled: true
---
spring:
  profiles: aws-production
  data:
    mongodb:
      host: 10.0.1.6
logging:
  level:
    root: WARN
management:
  info:
    git:
      enabled: false
    build:
      enabled: false
endpoints:
  sensitive: true
  enabled: false
  info:
    enabled: true
  health:
    enabled: true
---
spring:
  profiles: docker-production
  data:
    mongodb:
      host: mongodb
logging:
  level:
    root: WARN
management:
  info:
    git:
      enabled: false
    build:
      enabled: false
endpoints:
  sensitive: true
  enabled: false
  info:
    enabled: true
  health:
    enabled: true
```

All profile property values may be overridden on the command line, or in a `.conf` file. For example, to start the Voter service with the `aws-production` profile, but override the `mongodb.host` value with a new host address, you might use the following command:

```bash
java -jar <name_of_jar_file> \
  --spring.profiles.active=aws-production \
  --spring.data.mongodb.host=<new_host_address>
  -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom
```
